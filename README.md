- `git clone`: does a one-time download from github to your local computer
    - make sure the directory you are cloning is not already a git repo

- `git status`: tells you what's happening in your current git repository
- `git add <FILE>`: adds <FILE> to the staging area
- `git commit -m "MESSAGE"`: creates a commit (aka snapshot) with the changes in the staging area, with the message you supplied
